# Laravel Email Verification — Emailable Driver

An [Emailable](https://emailable.com) deliverability driver for
[`misaf/laravel-email-verification`](https://github.com/misaf/laravel-email-verification).

## Features

- Registers the `emailable` driver with the core manager
- Uses Emailable's verification API (`GET /v1/verify`)
- A server-side timeout below the HTTP client timeout, so a slow verification comes back as a clean result instead of a client abort
- Configurable timeouts and a retry budget owned by this package — only connection failures and 5xx responses are retried, so a 4xx never burns paid quota on an answer that cannot change
- Explicit mapping for every Emailable verification state
- Safe unverifiable results for provider failures, malformed payloads, timeouts, and unexpected responses

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4+
- Laravel 13
- `misaf/laravel-email-verification`

## Installation

```bash
composer require misaf/laravel-email-verification-emailable
```

The service provider auto-registers and adds an `emailable` driver to the
email verification manager. Point the core package at it:

```env
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DRIVER=emailable
EMAILABLE_HOST=https://api.emailable.com/v1/verify
EMAILABLE_API_KEY=your-key
```

Publish the config to override credentials:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=email-verification-emailable-config
```

An install command is also available, which publishes the config and walks you
through setup:

```bash
php artisan email-verification-emailable:install
```

## Configuration

`config/email-verification-emailable.php`:

- `host` — the Emailable verification endpoint, normally `https://api.emailable.com/v1/verify`
- `api_key` — the private Emailable API key
- `timeout.server` — the verification budget asked of Emailable (`EMAILABLE_SERVER_TIMEOUT`, default `5`)
- `timeout.client` — how long this application waits for the response (`EMAILABLE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`, default `6`). Keep it above `timeout.server`.
- `retry.times` — total attempts per verification (`EMAILABLE_RETRY_TIMES`, default `2`)
- `retry.sleep_milliseconds` — pause between attempts (`EMAILABLE_RETRY_SLEEP`, default `100`)

Only transient faults are retried: a connection failure, or a server-side 5xx.
A 4xx is never retried — a bad key or a rate limit cannot resolve itself, and
retrying it would only burn paid API quota.

```env
EMAILABLE_HOST=https://api.emailable.com/v1/verify
EMAILABLE_API_KEY=your-key

EMAILABLE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=6
EMAILABLE_SERVER_TIMEOUT=5
EMAILABLE_RETRY_TIMES=2
EMAILABLE_RETRY_SLEEP=100
```

Timeouts and retry behavior are configured here, not in the core package: the
core knows nothing about how a provider communicates.

## Verification Outcomes

| Emailable state | Core status | Validation result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deliverable` | `Deliverable` | Pass |
| `risky` | `Risky` | Fail |
| `undeliverable` | `Undeliverable` | Fail |
| `unknown` or unsupported | `Unverifiable` | Fail |

Malformed payloads, unsuccessful HTTP responses, timeouts, and exceptions also
produce `Unverifiable`. They are never treated as deliverable.

## Usage

Once `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DRIVER` points at `emailable`, the core `EmailValidation` rule
uses this driver with no further changes. To use it for a single rule
regardless of the configured default:

```php
use Misaf\LaravelEmailVerification\Rules\EmailValidation;

$request->validate([
    'email' => ['bail', 'email:rfc,strict', new EmailValidation('emailable')],
]);
```

### Verifying an address directly

```php
use Misaf\LaravelEmailVerification\Enums\EmailVerificationStatus;
use Misaf\LaravelEmailVerification\Facades\EmailVerification;

$status = EmailVerification::driver('emailable')->verify('user@example.com');

if ($status === EmailVerificationStatus::Deliverable) {
    // The provider positively classified the address as deliverable.
}
```
